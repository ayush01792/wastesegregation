♻ Waste Segregation System
An AI-powered web application for classifying waste into categories (e.g., Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous) using image processing and deep learning.

The project aims to automate waste classification to encourage proper disposal, improve recycling efficiency, and reduce environmental impact.

🚀 Features
📸 Image Upload – Users can upload waste images via the web interface.

🧠 AI-based Classification – Uses CNN model trained on waste images to classify waste.

📊 Confidence Scores – Displays probability for each category.

🌐 Interactive UI – Built with React for a smooth experience.

⚡ Real-time Prediction – Backend serves predictions instantly.

🔒 Secure File Handling – Validates file type and size.

🛠 Tech Stack

📊 Model Details
CNN trained on waste classification dataset (Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous, etc.)

Preprocessing with OpenCV: resizing, normalization

Data augmentation to improve accuracy

Accuracy: ~92% on test set

🌍 Deployment Notes
Use .env for storing API URLs and keys

CORS must be enabled in backend for frontend access

Compress model for faster inference (use tensorflow-lite or torchscript)

🧪 Testing
Use Postman to test /predict endpoint

Try images from different categories to check model robustness

🛡 Security & Limitations
Only image files (.jpg, .png) allowed

Max upload size: 5MB

Works best in good lighting with clear waste object visibility

📌 Future Improvements
Add multi-class sorting with confidence ranking

Integration with IoT waste bins for automatic sorting

Store predictions & stats in database for analytics

Multilingual UI
